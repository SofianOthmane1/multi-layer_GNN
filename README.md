# Multi-Layer_GNN
This repository holds the many learnings and failures of my masters thesis at University College London.

The thesis was written during my time at the BIS Innovation Hub in London. Summer 2025.

## Project outline
The project is on multi-layer contagion modelling. 

The project is broken up into 4 areas:
1. Node configuration
2. Edge simulation
3. Gound truth creation using DebtRank
4. Training of the GNN
5. Comparison of both methods
