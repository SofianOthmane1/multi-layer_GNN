# multi-layer_GNN
This repository holds the learnings and many failures of my masters thesis at University College London.

The thesis was written during my time at the BIS Innovation Hub in London.

## Project outline
The thesis is on multi-layer contagion modelling. Graph Neural Networks are trained on temporal contagion paths within an interconnected financial network.
Their performance is then analysed within each layer and evaluated.
