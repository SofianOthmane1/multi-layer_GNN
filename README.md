# Multi-Layer_GNN
This repository holds the learnings and many failures of my masters thesis at University College London.

The thesis was written during my time at the BIS Innovation Hub in London. Summer 2025.

## Project outline
The project is on multi-layer contagion modelling. 

Temporal synthetic financial network data are generated.
Graph Neural Networks are trained on the simulated temporal contagion paths within the network.
Their performance is then analysed within each layer and evaluated.
